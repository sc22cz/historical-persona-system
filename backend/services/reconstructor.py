RECONSTRUCT_PROMPT = """You are a historian writing a passage for an academic history book.

You have been asked to write a plausible historical narrative: what would {name} have done if they had faced a situation equivalent to the following modern action?

Modern action to adapt:
{action}

Known historical facts about {name}:
{raw_text}

Era context: {name} lived around {era_label}, in {civilization}. Consider the specific geography, social structure, gender roles, religious frameworks, political systems, and daily life constraints of that world. Do not apply modern frameworks.

Civilisation details:
- Region/geography: {region}
- Social structure: {social_structure}
- Gender context: {gender_context}

Behavioural profile of {name} (10 dimensions, 0.0–1.0):
- Reaction to oppression: {d0} (0=endures silently, 1=actively resists)
- Group dependency: {d1} (0=lone wolf, 1=relies on collective)
- Principle vs interest: {d2} (0=principle above all, 1=interest above all)
- Interpersonal trust: {d3} (0=highly open, 1=deeply suspicious)
- Change orientation: {d4} (0=preserve status quo, 1=radical change)
- Emotional stability: {d5} (0=calm and controlled, 1=emotional and impulsive)
- Core motivation: {d6} (0=idealism, 1=survival/power)
- Historical mission: {d7} (0=lives in present, 1=mission-driven)
- Response to injustice: {d8} (0=accepts and adapts, 1=anger and resistance)
- Expression style: {d9} (0=silent and reserved, 1=vocal and assertive)

Write a plausible historical narrative, in the style of a history book passage, describing what {name} would have done in an equivalent situation within their own time and place. Adapt the core dynamics of the modern action — its stakes, relationships, choices — into the actual world {name} inhabited. Write 2-3 paragraphs. Ground every inference in the behavioural profile and known facts. Begin the passage with the label: [FABRICATED HISTORY — {name}]
